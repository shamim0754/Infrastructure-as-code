# Infrastructure-as-code(IAC)
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure using configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface/Command line interface/Api. Most of cloud provider has own infrastructure as code machanism. Following are the example list
1. Iac tool for AWS is CloudFormation template
2. Iac tool for azure is Azure Resource Manager
3. Iac tool for Openstack is Head teamplate
4. Iac tool for GCP is Google Cloud Deployment Manager

# Why terraform 
We can manage multiple cloud platform using single Iac tool called terraform. we don't need individual cloud iac tool
Competitor for terraform called `pulumi`/crossplane
